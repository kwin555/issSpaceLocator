Assign2: Due 11:59PM October 4

Take small steps. Start with a canary test and one or two more tests.
List your tests in a file named tests.txt. Check them off with a x as you 
implement them. Remember to ask for a review each day. The earlier you start,
the earlier you finish, and less the risk. If you start late, you carry a 
bigger risk. Your call. Now to the assignment.
                                                                         
We will write a program that will take a lat and lon from a user as input on the command line. The program will then compute and display the time, in local time zone, when the ISS will be overhead next time.

For example, a user may enter

29.721670, 95.343631

The program may output

11:17 PM

where 11:17 PM may be the next time, based on when the program was run, ISS will be overhead at that lat and lon.

We can find out the actual details by making a request to a webservice, like so:

http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json?lat=29.721670&lon=-95.343631&n=1
                                                                         
Write the program in a way that it gracefully deals with network failures and also failure of the webservice.
