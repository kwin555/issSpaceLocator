x computeTimeOfFlyOver passes lat and lon to fetchIssFlyOverData
x computeTimeOfFlyOver returns time based on timestamp returned by fetchIssFlyOverData
x computeTimeOfFlyOver gracefully reports error due to error from webservice
x computeTimeOfFlyOver gracefully reports network failure

x parse data and return timestamp for one sample JSON data
x parse data and return timestamp for another sample JSON data
x parse data with error message for lat being too large
x parse data with error message for lon being too large

x fetchIssFlyOverData calls service and passes response to parse data
x fetchIssFlyOverData returns timestamp returned by parse
x fetchIssFlyOverData returns error returned by parse
x fetchIssFlyOverData gracefully returns network exception from call to service

x integration test, fetchIssFlyOverData returns some timestamp returned for a lat lon
